# Smart Chip Application for Direct Library Prep

## Installation and Setup

The application consists of the following files: 
- SmartChipApp.jar
- SmartChipApp.ini
- SmartChipApp.xls
- OpenCV_java310.dll (opencv.org)

All the files must be placed in the same directory/folder. 
One can create a Shortcut to the SmartChipApp.jar file and use it to access the application. 
The SmartChipApp.xls file does not need to be in the same directory as the other files in order 
for the application to run.  It is advisable to use this parameter as a backup and edit copies 
of this file for each new experiment.  
   
The application has been tested to execute under the Windows 7 or 10, 64 bit operating system.
It works best on systems with 2 display monitors: one for each of the 2 application windows (Main and Mosaic). 
The application also needs Java 1.8 (64 bit) installed to operate.
